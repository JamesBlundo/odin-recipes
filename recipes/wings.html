        Description    
    </h2>
        <p>Buffalo wings are a quintessential American bar food, originating in Buffalo, New York, in the 1960s. These crispy, deep-fried or baked chicken wings are traditionally coated in a tangy, buttery hot sauce and served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. Their bold, spicy flavor and satisfying crunch have made them a favorite for casual gatherings, game days, and late-night snacks.</p>
        <p>What sets Buffalo wings apart is their perfect balance of heat and richness. The vinegar-laced hot sauce provides a punchy kick, while the melted butter softens the heat, creating an addictive glaze. Easy to customize with varying heat levels and sauces, Buffalo wings have become a versatile staple in American cuisine, beloved by spice lovers everywhere.</p>
