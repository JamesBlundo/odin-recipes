        Description    
    </h2>
        <p>Ribeye Steak is a juicy, flavorful cut of beef known for its marbled fat, which enhances the richness and tenderness of the meat. When cooked to perfection, ribeye boasts a crispy sear on the outside while remaining tender and juicy on the inside. This steak is often considered one of the best due to its robust flavor and melt-in-your-mouth texture. Whether grilled, pan-seared, or oven-roasted, a perfectly cooked ribeye is a showstopper for any steak lover.</p>
        <p>To make Pan-Seared Ribeye, start by bringing the steak to room temperature and seasoning both sides with salt and pepper. Heat a heavy skillet, preferably cast iron, over high heat. Once hot, add a bit of oil and sear the steak for 4-5 minutes on each side until a golden-brown crust forms. For added flavor, add butter, garlic, and thyme to the pan during the last minute of cooking, basting the steak with the flavorful butter. Let the steak rest for a few minutes before slicing to lock in the juices. Serve with your favorite sides for a truly indulgent meal.</p>
